# Source Code for Personal Blog and Portfolio

This is my playground for testing new features and learning the best web dev practices out there. It contains my portfolio projects, writings and experiments. Designers, feel free to reach out to me for help with building your online portfolios. I will be moving away from this soon and adopting a Framer website for ease of use. 

* Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
* Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* Styled using [Tailwind CSS v3.2](https://tailwindcss.com)
* Content managed using [Cosmic.js CMS](https://www.cosmicjs.com)
* Uses [Plausible's](https://plausible.io/) privacy-friendly Analytics as well as recently introduced Vercel Analytics. 

As of v2, here are some more features, 
* Masonry style card layout for home page (currently driven simply by images)
* Opinionated dark mode, with no toggle
* Toggle for long form and short form intro

As I am using a CMS, without setting up a mock cosmicJS account, you won't be able to deploy and run the code. I will create a mock cosmic account when I get time. 


### Future updates
I will be releasing a major update to the portfolio in the coming weeks. This would bring the following changes,
1. Move away from CMS in favor for Markdown
2. Upgrade Next.js to v13
