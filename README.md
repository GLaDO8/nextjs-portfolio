# Source Code for Personal Blog and Portfolio

This is my playground for testing new features and learning the best web dev practices out there. It contains my portfolio projects, writings and experiments. Designers, feel free to reach out to me for help with building your online portfolios. I will be moving away from this soon and adopting a Framer website for ease of use. 

* Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
* Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* Styled using [Tailwind CSS v3.2](https://tailwindcss.com)
* Content managed using [Cosmic.js CMS](https://www.cosmicjs.com)

TODO 
* Use `next/font` with self-hosted Inter from Google Fonts
* Become markdown native and move away from Cosmic CMS

As I am using a CMS, without setting up a mock cosmicJS account, you won't be able to deploy and run the code. I will create a mock cosmic account when I get time.
